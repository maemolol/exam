# Theory

1. A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used for storing and managing collections of data. It consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains both data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.
2. There are several advantages to linked lists: 1) dynamic size: linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, as nodes can be easily added or removed without the need for contiguous memory allocation; 2) ease of insertion and deletion: Insertion and deletion operations are efficient, especially for singly linked lists, as they only require updating references to neighboring nodes; 3) their versatility: linked lists can be implemented in various forms such as singly, doubly and circular linked lists, each suited to different scenarios and 4) memory allocation flexibility: linked lists don't require contiguous memory allocation, making them suitable for situations where contiguous memory is not available or not efficient.  
However, there are some disadavntages to linked lists, like 1) sequential access: unlike arrays, linked lists don't support efficient random access to elements. Accessing an element in a linked list typically requires traversing the list from the beginning and checking every element, which can be inefficient for large lists; 2) memory overhead: each node in a linked list requires additional memory for storing the reference to the next node, leading to higher memory overhead compared to arrays, especially for singly linked lists; 3) cache performance: traversing a linked list may result in poor cache performance compared to arrays, as the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and 4) extra complexity: implementing and manipulating linked lists often requires more complex code compared to arrays, especially for operations like reversing or sorting.
3. The uses of linked lists are 1) dynamic memory allocation: linked lists are often used in dynamic memory allocation systems, such as those in programming languages like C and C++, where memory needs to be allocated and deallocated dynamically; 2) a base for stacks and queues: linked lists are used as a base for stack and queue data structures, where elements are added and removed in either a last-in-first-out (LIFO) or a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, respectively; 3) file systems: linked lists can be used to represent file systems' directories and their contents, where each node represents a directory or a file, and the links represent the hierarchical relationships between them and 4) undo functionality: linked lists can be used to implement undo functionality in text editors or other software applications, where each node represents a state of the document, and the links represent the sequence of changes made.
